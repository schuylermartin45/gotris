# Gotris (v1.0)

## An implementation of Tetris in Go following MVC design principles

## Description
This is a simple text (and maybe GUI in the future)-based version of Tetris
written in Go.

## Personal Goals with this Project
* Learn Go
* Implement something that is close to being Tetris with some personal flair
* Use the principles of MVC design to have multiple rendering options for
  the game. To start with, there will be a simple text debugging mode and
  then later there will be a fancier text mode and maybe a GUI.
* Have fun
  * (And by "have fun" I mean I'm attempting to use reduce memory
  overhead by using compact data structures...so I can do some fancy bit
  twiddling).

## Requirements
Go v1.13 is required as it supports binary literals. See [this](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/19308) 
issue on GitHub for more info.

## Dependencies
Go lacks a lot of old-school terminal control abilities (`clear`, `getch()`,
etc) so this project uses a 3rd party, cross platform library used by a number
of other text-based Go games, [tcell](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell).

### To Install:
#### Automatic
```bash
make depend
```
