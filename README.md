# Gotris

## An implementation of Tetris in Go following MVC design principles

## Description
This is a simple text (and maybe GUI in the future)-based version of Tetris
written in Go.

## Personal Goals with this Project
* Learn Go
* Implement something that is close to being Tetris with some personal flair
* Use the principles of MVC design to have multiple rendering options for
  the game. To start with, there will be a simple text debugging mode and
  then later there will be a fancier text mode and maybe a GUI.
* Have fun

## Build Intstructions
```bash
make
```

## Usage
```bash
./bin/gotris [render mode]
```
